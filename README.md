# BloggingWebsite
This is a blogging website where a logged in user can write a blog. If not they have to login and sign up accordingly. Moreover anyone can read the blogs irrespective of their signing up status.

In order to create this project I used HTML and Bootstrap in front end while Django in the back end.

I also inserted some sample users and blogs.
In order to have access to admin panel just simply use username "admin" with password "admin"
